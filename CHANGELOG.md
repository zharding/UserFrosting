- Move `composer.json` to root directory to allow installing UF via composer create-project

- Sprinkle initializer classes now use events to hook into application lifecycle
- Support for allowing Sprinkles to register middleware (#617)
- Automatically load Sprinkle service providers (see #636)
- Get rid of "implicit loading" for core Sprinkle - core is now just an ordinary Sprinkle like any other.
- The `sprinkles://` stream now represents a virtual filesystem for the root directory of each loaded sprinkle, rather than the `sprinkles/` directory itself.
- Separate out `localePathBuilder` from the `translator` service.  Makes it easier to add/remove paths before actually loading the translations.

- Added user and session cache.
- Common log file for db queries, auth checks, smtp, errors, and debug messages (#709).

See [http://learn.userfrosting.com/upgrading/40-to-41](Upgrading 4.0.x to 4.1.x documentation) for complete list of changes and breaking changes.

- Fix bug in ufCollection

## v4.0.22-Alpha
- Fix issue where 'Change User Password' popup form couldn't handle specifying a new password.
- Display message when there are no results in `ufTable`

## v4.0.21-Alpha
- Implement reflow and column selector for tables (#670)
- Overhauled ufAlerts, improving efficiency, reliability, and fixed a discovered edge case that caused `render` to never complete. (part of #646)
- ufAlerts will only auto-scroll when outside the viewport (even if only partially). Can be overriden with `scrollWhenVisible: true`. (#714)
- Rebased ufCollection, and ufForm with new jQuery plugin template. (part of #646)
- Misc UI update
- Added Twig blocks
- Fix issue with duplicate query logs when using multiple databases

## v4.0.20-Alpha
- Remove pivot columns from pagination subquery in BelongsToManyThrough, to deal with MySQL's `only_full_group_by` warning

## v4.0.19-Alpha
- Explicit column names in new user permissions relations

## v4.0.18-Alpha
- Permission info page (#638)

- Fix issue with Sprunje when generating CSV with empty child collections (#697)
- Authorizer now correctly interprets string literals (#482)
- Authorizer now correctly interprets numeric types in access conditions.  **Caution**: this causes the `equals()` callback to return true in situations where it would have (incorrectly) returned false before.  For example, `equals(self.group_id,2)` would have returned false for users in group 2, because it was interpreting `2` as a string and then performing its strict comparison.  It now (correctly) returns true.  Notice that `equals(self.group_id,'2')`, on the other hand, will now return `false`.
